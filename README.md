# work_day_scheduler

## Project Description

This project was designed to build a day planner webpage that will store entered data and work with an online clock to set css style changes based on the time of day.  Withthe help of Bootstrap, jquery and Moment() js.  We are able to create a page that will show the user what actions are coded based on what time it is that day and what activities they have entered.

The rows for each hour will be displayed a different color.  There are three colors, one for past, present and future.
